# Change Log
All notable changes to the "LS Retail Update Service Workspace" extension will be documented in this file.

## [1.4.0]
### Added
- A new command called *Manage Installs* that offers the following management operations:
    - Assign an install to a specific package group in *gocurrent.json*
        - This allows the user to add or remove packages (apps) from the current installation, for example, to add the Business Central test suite packages.
    - Check for updates for individual install.
    - Remove installation.
- *Download Dependencies* now has an option to download dependencies for all projects in the workspace.
- *Compile and Create Package* now has an option to select one or more projects in the workspace, which compiles the projects in dependency order.
- A notification, *Import to Server*, now pops up when a package is created, offering the user to import the newly created package to a server.
### Changes
- The *Remove Packages* command was removed in favor of the new *Manage Installs*.
### Fixed
- When checking for updates for multiple installations and one had an error, it would stop checking for updates for the remaining installs.

## [1.3.0]
### Changes
- *Download dependencies (.alpackages + .netpackage)* changed accordingly:
    - Will not download other apps included in the VS Code workspace.
    - If a dependency has *propagateDependencies* set to true, its dependencies will also download.
    - Apps are renamed to the form *PUBLISHER_NAME_VERSION* when placed into the *.alpackages* directory.

## [1.2.2]
### Changes
- Added the new *ls-central-system-app* to the *app-id-to-package-id* map.
### Fixed

- Incorrect version query format resulted in a *No updates availble* message, now tells which package has the invalid query.

- Error notifications are sometimes displayed twice.
- Cryptic error notifications [Object].

## [1.2.0]

### Changed
- All references to *Go Current* in the user interface have been changed to *LS Update Service*.
- *Compile and create package* now includes AL compilation errors output if any.

### Fixed
- Now, when you right-click on *gocurrent.json->Import dependencies from app.json* it doesn't ask the user which workspace to use, rather uses the workspace where *gocurrent.json* is located.
